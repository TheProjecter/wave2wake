# Introduction #

wave2wake is an android app which helps you to snooze off the alarm clock just by a wave of hand. It operates in background as well, even if the app is not currently open.


# Details #

The app has a user interface which displays time, date and day in the center and has a button on the top left which helps the user to add an alarm, the user can set multiple alarms and can deactivate it just by single touch. User can further edit an existing alarm by not only changing the time and ringtone of the alarm but also if it should repeat on multiple days in a week or if he wants to give a specific name to the alarm.

On the right hand side of the app, there is a button for settings which not only helps user to change the basic alarm settings but also enables him to activate gestures like:

**Motion detection** - Shake the phone to snooze off or disable alarm as per the settings.

**Voice detection** - Speak "alarm off", "snooze off" to put alarm off and snooze it respectively or even ask "what time is it" to hear current time.

**Keep in pocket** - Alarm goes off, if it detects that the user has put the phone in pocket and is now awake.
